Silverlight & WPF Event Calendar
================================
This is a very lightweight event calendar control for Silverlight and WPF. It can be integrated to the project only by adding one CS files. It has some nice features:

- It is bindable to any collection. Each element in the collection needs to expose a DateTime property which can be used in order to place the "events" in the calendar.
- It is stylable. DataTemplate can be defined for every event which is added to the collection.
- It is based on standard Calendar control.
